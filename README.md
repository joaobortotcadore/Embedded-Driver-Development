# Embedded-Driver-Development
Mastering Microcontroller with Embedded Driver Development, this is my repository that I created it while learning about drivers for STM32 (GPIO,I2C,SPI,USART,etc) and I share it with people taking the FastBit Embedded Brain Academy MCU1 course as well. Lots of comments and links to add to learning. Enjoy!
